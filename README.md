# WCSRO

Welcome!
This package calculates the Warren-Cowley short range order parameter (SRO) for arbitrary alloys. It is meant to consider not only pairs, but also triplets.

## Usage

To use the calculator, open WCSRO.jl. All further steps are explained there.

## Latest update 
* The package can now handle an arbitrary number of different elements.
* Periodic boundary conditions have been implemented.
* Usage of structs (getting rid of global variables)
* More detailed comments
* better plots, little syntax improvements
