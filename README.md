Welcome!

This package calculates the Warren-Cowley short range order parameter (SRO) for binary and ternary alloys. It is meant to consider not only pairs, but also triplets.

The current version includes all important initialisation and sorting steps as well as the calculations of all SROs. However, everything is quite chaotic.

The package is still in development, do NOT use it!
